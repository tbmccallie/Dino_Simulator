# Dino_Simulator
I'm creating a basic dinosaur simulator which shows a dinosaur sprite moving around in its enclosure. 
I will use this to learn more about pygame and python in general. 
I am starting with just a dinosaur sprite moving around its enclosure and will eventually add hunger and thirst meters that deteriorate over time, along with water and a food source.
