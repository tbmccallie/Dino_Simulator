# Dino_Simulator
I created a basic dinosaur simulator which shows a dinosaur sprite moving around in its enclosure. 
I used this to learn more about pygame and python in general. 
I started with just a dinosaur sprite moving around its enclosure and eventually added hunger and thirst meters that deteriorate over time, along with water and a food source that the dinosaur goes to when its hunger and thirst cross certain thresholds.
